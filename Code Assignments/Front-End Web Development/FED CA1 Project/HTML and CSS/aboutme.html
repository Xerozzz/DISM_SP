                I am currently studying Diploma in Infocomm Security Management in <a href="https://www.sp.edu.sg/" target=_blank>Singapore Polytechnic.</a>
                I was born in August 2002, and my horoscope is a Leo! I am a very outgoing and extroverted person who has no problems
                talking and meeting new people! As a result, I love socializing and making new friends! </p>

                <p id="secondpara">Since I was young, I've always loved football and supported <a href="https://www.manutd.com/" target=_blank>Manchester United Football Club </a>thanks to the influence
                 of one of my uncles. I am an avid MUFC fan and support them in their highs and lows. I am rather proud of my collection
                of every home jersey since 2005, and owning five Manchester United footballs as well!</p>
                
                <p id="thirdpara">I play football as a hobby too. Since young I've always waited for the recess bell to ring
                so that I could sprint to the field and kick around with my classmates. Nowadays, I usually play on friday nights with a few groups of adults.</p>

                <p id="fourthpara">Another one of my hobbies is music, both making and listening to it! I play the trumpet and perform in symphonic bands and orchestras.
                More on that <a href="music.html" target=_blank>here</a>. I love listening to most genres of music, such as classical, pop, instrumental, vocals, rock and many more!
                Some of my favourite composers include Dvorak, Haydn, Mahler. I don't really have a favorite pop artist. </p>
