# Module 1: Cloud Concepts Overview

# Part 1: What is Cloud Computing?

## Cloud Computing

### Definition

- The on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing
- Cloud computing allows you to stop thinking of your infrastructure as hardware, and instead think of it as software

### Difficulties of Hardware

- Hardware solutions require
    - Space
    - Staff
    - Physical Security
    - Planning
    - Capital Expenditure
- What if your needs change?
    - Is there enough capacity?
    - What if you have too much or too little storage?

### Benefits of Software

- Software is flexible
- If your needs change, your software can change much more quickly, easily and cost-effectively than your hardware

## Three Models of Cloud Computing

### IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

- Most control over IT resources
- Provides storage space and hardware

### PaaS (Platform as a Service)

- Hardware and OS
- More control over IT resources

### SaaS (Software as a Service)

- End-user applications
- Less control over IT resources

## Three Cloud Deployment Models

### All-In Cloud

- All data stored in the cloud

### Hybrid

- Some of the data in the cloud some on premises

### Private Cloud (On-Premises)

- Data completely on premises and none in the cloud

### All-In Cloud                              vs

- No upfront investment
- Low ongoing costs
- Focus on innovation
- Flexible capacity
- Speed and agility
- Global reach on demand

### On-Premises

- Large initial purchase
- Labor,patches and upgrade cycles
- Systems administration
- Fixed capacity
- Long procurement cycle and setup
- Limited geographic regions

## What can you do in the cloud?

- Application Hosting
- Backup and Storage
- Content Delivery
- Websites
- Enterprise IT
- Databases

## Important Cloud Terminology

### High Availability

- Accessible when you need it

### Fault Tolerance

- Ability to withstand a certain amount of failure and still remain functional

### Scalability

- Ability to grow in size, capacity and/or scope when required
- Growth is usually based on demand

### Elasticity

- Ability to grow when required and reduce in size when resources are no longer needed

# Part 2: Six Benefits of Cloud Computing

## #1 Trade Capital Expense for Variable Expense

- Data center investment based on forecast, regardless of if you use it
- Cloud pays for what you use only

## #2 Benefit from massive Economies of Scale

- Hardware solutions are physical and require space, staff and physical security
- Significant cost to procure and house these resources

## #3 Capacity Planning

- Eliminate guessing your capacity needs
- Scaling on demand

## #4 Speed and Agility

- Increase speed and agility
- Get resources needed a click away and immediately instead of weeks
- Lower cost and time to experiment and development

## #5 Spend Strategically

- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
- Focus on projects that move the business instead of infrastructure

## #6 Go Global in Minutes

- Go global in minutes
- Multiple AWS regions around the world
- Provide lower latency and better experience for customers at minimal cost

# Part 3: What is AWS?

## Web Services

- A web service is any piece of software that makes itself available over the internet and uses a standardized format for the request and response of an API interaction

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)

### Definition

- Secure cloud platform that provides more than 165 different services and solutions
- AWS offers flexibility
- AWS Services work together like building blocks
