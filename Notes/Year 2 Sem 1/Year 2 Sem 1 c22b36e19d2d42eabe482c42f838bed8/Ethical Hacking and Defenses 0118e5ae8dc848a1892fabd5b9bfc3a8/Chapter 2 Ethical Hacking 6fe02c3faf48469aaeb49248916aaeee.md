# Chapter 2: Ethical Hacking

# Ethical Hacker

## Definitions

### Hacker

- A term to describe of someone who accesses computer systems or networks without authorization
- Also known as a cracker

### Ethical hacker

- performs these activities but with the owner's permission

### Penetration Test

- Legal attempt to break into company's network to find its weakest link
- Employed by companies to perform pen tests

## Skills Sets of an Ethical Hacker

### Hackers

- Typically skillful computer experts

### Script Kiddies and Packet Moneys

- Young inexperienced hackers
- Copy codes and techniques from knowledgeable hackers
- May not understand the software they are using

### Ethical Hacker Problems

- Only instruction given may be "Make sure the company doesn't get hacked"

# Cyber Security Exercises

- Organizations may conduct cyber security exercises to train their IT security Personnel

## Teams

### Red Team

- Typically acts as attackers

### Blue Team

- Defends the organization's networks

### Purple Team

- Work with both red and blue teams, analyzing how each team works, reviewing the results, sharing knowledge

## What does a Penetration Tester Do?

![Chapter%202%20Ethical%20Hacking%206fe02c3faf48469aaeb49248916aaeee/Untitled%202.png](Chapter%202%20Ethical%20Hacking%206fe02c3faf48469aaeb49248916aaeee/Untitled%202.png)

## Penetration Testing Methodologies

### White Box Model

- Tester is told everything about the network topology and technology
- Tester is authorized to interview IT personnel and company employees
- Makes tester job a bit easier

### Black Box Model

- Tester is not given details about the network
- Burden is on the tester to find these details
- Company staff does not know about the security test
- Tests if security personnel are able to detect an attack

### Gray Box Model

- Hybrid of White and Black box models
- Tester is given partial information
- Staff may be informed about security test to be conducted

## Stages of Penetration Testing

### Stage 1: Information Gathering (Footprinting)

- Gather information about target from publicly available sources

### Stage 2: Network Discovery

- Discover what's in the target's network
- Network scanning

### Stage 3: Vulnerability Assessment

- Look for possible vulnerabilities in the network

### Stage 4: Exploiting

- Test the vulnerabilities to see if they can be exploited
- Test if possible to gain access to the systems to do attacks

### Stage 5: Post-Exploit

- May include planting backdoors to ensure persistent access to the systems, covering up tracks etc

# Laws

## Laws of the Land

- Laws involving technology change as rapidly as technology itself
- FInd what is legal for you locally, laws change from place to place
- Be aware of what is allowed and what is not
- Some cyber security tools are illegal to possess on the tester's laptop
- Contact law enforcement agencies before installing hacking tools
- Governments are getting more serious about cybercrimes

## Is Port Scanning Legal?

- Legal in some states and illegal in others
- Always ensure you have permission to scan the network
- Port scanning can generate high volume of traffic so narrow the scan range to minimize generated traffic

## Computer Crime Laws

- Cybersecurity Act
- Computer Misuse Act

# PenTesting

## Performing The Test/Scan

- Before starting, tester should discuss with the client on scope of work
- Be specific
- Some clients may want only until stage 3
- Some clients may only want a subnet or half their network tested
- Pentester needs to be careful on what he tests so the client's systems are not affected
- Penetration tester may explain to the client the scans or tests he is planning and highlight the possible effect on the client's network and systems
- If network slowdown is unavoidable, test during off-peak times

## Get It In Writing

- Penetration tester should have contract from client
- Useful in court in case of disputes
- Have an attorney read over your contract before sending or signing it

## Writing a PenTest Report

- After pentest is complete, a report has to be written for the client
- Usually contains
    - Scope of tests (Which systems are tested)
    - Methodology used (Black, white or gray)
    - Results of vulnerability assessment (What the tester found out abt the systems)
    - Recommendations (How to mitigate the security risks found)
- Keep the report secure as it contains sensitive information!
- Information must be kept strictly confidential
- Deliver report to client securely

## Ethical Hacking in a Nutshell

### What it takes to be a security tester

- Knowledge of network and computer technology
- Ability to communicate with management and IT personnel
- Understanding of the laws
- Ability to use necessary tools
