**Introduction to Evidence Analysis:**

- Evidence is defined as the legal means which tend to prove or disprove any matter of fact, the truth of which is submitted for judicial investigation in an open court of law
- In both criminal and civil proceedings, the rules of evidence must be complied with
- All evidence introduced during trial must be relevant and admissable
- Rules of evidence in SG found and governed in Evidence Act (Cap 97) and to a lesser extent the common law
- Evidence Act is inclusive by nature and sets out all provable facts in terms of its relevancy

**The Burden of Proof:**

Details:

- Courts decision in every case will depend on whether parties have satisfied the **burden and standard of proof** that has been imposed by the law on him/her
- Section 103 of Evidence Act - Clearly states that whoever asserts must bear the burden of proving the facts in issue to support his assertion
- "Facts in issue" are all those facts with a plantiff in a civil action or the PP in any criminal proceedings must prove in order to succeed, together with any further facts the defendant or accused must prove in order to establish a credible defence

Legal Burden of Proof:

- Facts in issue sometimes known as **"Legal Burden of Proof"**
- In criminal cases, the burden always remains on the prosecution in relation to facts in issue throughout the entire trial
- Legal burden of proof must be distinguished with the **"Evidential burden of proof"** specified under Section 104 of the Evidence Act

**Evidential Burden of Proof:**

Details:

- Means that the prosecution, in addition to legal burden of proof it bears, must also adduce sufficient evidence to meet the standard required to prove the facts that are in issue
- If prosecution's evidence is weak, the defence may submit that there is no case to answer and accused will be acquitted

Standard of Proof - Criminal:

- In criminal cases, when the **prosecution** is required to prove facts in issue, he must do so "**beyond a reasonable doubt**"
- If accused relies on any defences or exceptions to liability spelt out in statutes, he must prove them on a "**balance of probabilities**"

Standard of Proof - Civil:

- In civil cases, both the plantiff and defendent must as a general rule prove the facts in issue which they assert and also any defences they rely on based on a "**balance of probabilities**"

Beyond a Reasonable Doubt:

- It need not reach certainty, but must carry a high degree of probability
- If evidence is so strong as to only leave only a remote possibility in his favour
- "of course it is possible, but not in the least possible"

Balance of Probabilities:

- Must carry a reasonable degree of probability
- "More probable than not"

Circumstantial Evidence and Relevant Facts:

- Very often, direct evidence of the facts in issue is not available in which case the parties must rely on proving the facts which tend to prove the facts in issue

**Relevant Facts:**

Details:

- Under the Evidence Act, a fact is relevant to another when one is connected with other in any of the ways referred to under Part I of the Act
- Part I of the Act spells out a variety of general and specific categories of facts which are to be treated as relevant
- General categories covered by Section 6 to 11 of the Act

Section 6:

- Facts which form part of the same transaction are relevant facts

Section 7:

- Facts which are the occasion, cause or effect of the facts in issue are relevant facts

Section 8:

- Facts which show motive, preparation and previous or subsequent conduct are relevant facts

Section 9:

- Facts necessary to explain or introduce relevant facts are themselves relevant

Section 10:

- Facts showing things said or done by conspirator in reference to a common intention or conspiracy are relevant facts

Section 11:

- Facts which are normally irrelevant becomes relevant when
    - They are inconsistent with any fact in issue or relevant fact
    - IF by themselves or in connections with other facts they make the existence or non-existence of any fact in issue or relevant fact highly probably or improbable

**Similar Fact Evidence:**

- Section 14 and 15 of the Act deals with situations under which the accused acts or state of mind on occasions other than the present one giving rise to the offence charged, will be deemed relevant by virtue of their similarity to that offence
- Eg. A sues B for injuries inflicted by B’s ferocious dog. The fact that the dog had previously bitten X who had lodged a complaint to NEA would be a relevant fact
    - Such facts would be admissible as a matter of law, but there is judicial discretion granted to exclude its admissibility if its effect is overly prejudicial

**Rule Against Hearsay:**

- Under Section 62 of the Evidence Act requires direct evidence be given
- Provided that a witness who gives oral evidence must testify as to what he himself perceived. He is NOT permitted to testify to facts in issue or relevant facts which are perceived by other persons and which were recounted to him

Rationale:

- Witness cannot verify the truth of facts of which he has no personal knowledge
- As the person who has personal knowledge is not in court, the accuracy of his perception cannot be assessed and be tested in cross-examination
- Possibility of fabrication is increased in situations of hearsay

**Admissions:**

- Section 17 of the Evidence Act defines **admissions** as "a statement oral or documentary which suggests any inference as to any fact in issue or relevant fact"
- Section 21 further goes on to state that admissions may be proved against the person who made it and can be proved in both civil and criminal cases
- In criminal cases, the admission may constitute a confession

**Confession:**

- Section 17(2) of the Evidence Act defines a **confessions** as an admission by an accused person which states or suggests the inference that he committed the offence

Conditions:

- Must admit to all elements of the offence that constitute the offence, both the intention and the unlawful act
- Must be made voluntarily without inducement, threat or promise
- Must be made to a police officer Sergeant and above to be admissible

**Admissibility vs Weight:**

Admissibility:

- Question of law
- Depends on relevancy of evidence
- Evidence does not infringe any provisions under the Evidence Act

Weight:

- The value it would place on the evidence
- Whether the court is likely to believe the evidence
