Procedural Law:

Controversy or Problems:

- Right to Counsel
- Obtaining Illegal Evidence
- Lack of Discovery - Exchange of Information

Right to Counsel:

- Art 9(3): Where a person is arrested, he shall be informed as soon as may be of the grounds of his arrest and shall be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioners of his choice
- 3 related right
    - Right to be informed as soon as may be of the grounds of arrest

- No need to inform Accused his right to seek counsel
- No need to provide counsel immediately upon arrest but within a reasonable time
- A reasonable time must be given to police to carry out its investigations. Burden is on the prosecution to satisfy the Court that it is "reasonable" to withhold access to counsel so that it will not hinder police investigations

**Illegally Obtained Evidence:**

Details:

- Relates to role of "agent provocateur"
- Is a person who acts undercover a partner in crime?
- Evidence unlawfully obtained is admissible as long as it is relevant

Example:

- For instance, if drilling a hole into a hotel room to record the adulterous activities of a cheating spouse would land you in trouble with the law (trespass, damage to property), is it still possible to use as admissible evidence?

Suggestion/Advice:

- Supervision of the raid team should not be the solicitors of the applicant of the raid
- Appoint a supervisor to supervise the raid
- All documents should be collected in a box and properly identified and sealed
- All storage devices should be individually tagged and sealed. No downloading required on site

Art 9 (3) Issue of Discovery:

- No legal obligation to disclose any information to the accused person
- This lack of information makes it difficult for defence counsel to advise the accused and properly prepare his defence
- What defence lawyers need most are statements from their clients and witnesses written by the police in the course of an investigation. Their clients can have difficulty recalling what they said in their statements to the police which may be given up to 18 months before their court appearance

**Prosecution's Response:**

- Prosecution - If an accused person is telling the truth, he should be able to recollect for his counsel what he told the police
- Use of Statements - In recent years, it has become fashionable for the prosecution to impeach the credibility of an accused person if he deviates from his statements
- If judge agrees with impeachment, it has a direct and adverse impact on an accused person's case and defence

**Police Statements:**

- Police generally take several types of statements
    - First Information Report
    - Witness Statements
    - Cautioned Statement (Confession)
- Statements must be made without threat, inducement or promise

**Charging the Accused:**

- Once police have completed their investigation, the Investigation Officer will submit his investigation papers to the AGC for the public prosecutor to consider whether to initiate a criminal prosecution
- Once a decision has been made to proceed, the case will be prepared for trial. The charge or charges are then drafted

Drafting the Charge:

- The Charge notifies the accused of the offence for which he is to be prosecuted
- It is fundamental to ensure that the charge is clear and sufficiently precise for the accused to know exactly what he is being accused of so that he may be able to answer the case against him

What is stated in charge:

- Accused Name
- Gender/Age
- NRIC
- Date, time and place of alleged offence
- Provision of the law and nature of the alleged offence
- Punishment of the offence

General Rules Regarding Charges:

- One offence per charge
- Amendments to charge, any amendments or irregularities will not invalidate the proceedings

**Trial Procedure:**

- Criminal Trial Procedure is conducted in different ways in the State Courts and the High Court
- A High Court trial is normally preceded by a committal hearing/preliminary inquiry conducted by a magistrate to determine whether there is sufficient grounds to commit to trial
- Cases tried by State courts do not need committal hearings/preliminary inquires and are called "summary trials"

PG Cases:

- Set out in Section 158 of CPC
- Accused is brought before the court, the charge is read out and explained to him and he is asked whether he pleads guilty. If he choose to remain silent, this has the effect of a not guilty plea

Accused Claims Trial:

- If accused pleads not guilty, a full length trial commences as follows
- The prosecution opens its case by calling its witnesses one by one. Each witness is examined, cross-examines and re-examined
- Throughout the trial, the prosecution has to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt
- At the conclusion of the prosecution's case, the accused may submit that there is "no case to answer" in that the prosecution has failed to make out all the ingredients of the charge and the prosecutor may reply to the submission
- Arguments by both sides are then presented
- The court will then decide, and, if satisfied prosecution has not made up a prima facie case, acquit the accused
- If the court decides the prosecution has made out a case, it will call upon the accused to present his defence
- The court may also decide whether the charges need amendment at this stage before calling the accused to give his defence
- The defence will then open its case and call its witnesses who are examined, cross-examined and re-examined
- The accused may choose to give evidence or remain silent. The first option means he renders himself open to X-examination. The second option allows the court to draw whatever interference from the the silence it wants to
- Closing submission by defence and prosecution's right of reply
- Judgement,conviction, plea in mitigation and sentencing

High Court Trials:

- Once the magistrate has concluded the Committal Hearings and is satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to commit to a High Court Trial, the trial will be fixed for trial in the HCourt
- The procedure is very similar to full-length summary trial, with minor variations

Appeals:

- Either prosecution or the accused dissatisfied with the decision may file a notice of appeal
- The accused may appeal against both conviction and sentence and the prosecution may appeal against the accused acquittal or sentence in that it is manifestly inadequate
