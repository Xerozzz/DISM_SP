    - Properly used
    - Ordinarily Produced

4 Steps Computer Evidence:

- PReserve
- Analyze
- Present

**Presumptions in Relation to Electronic Records:**

Details:

- In addition, there will be new presumptions facilitating the admission of electronic records - introduced by the Evidence Act 2012

EA s116A(1):

- Where a device is one that, if properly used, accurately communicates an electronic record, it will be presumed that an electronic record communicated by that device was accurately communicated
- ***Illustration.*** A seeks to adduce evidence in the form of an electronic record or document produced by an electronic device or process. A proves that the electronic device/process is of a kind that if properly used, ordinarily produces the electronic record/document. This is a relevant fact for the court to presume that in producing the record, the electronic device/process produced the electronic record/document which A seeks to adduce.

EA s116A(2):

- Unless evidence to the contrary is adduced, the court shall presume that any electronic record generated, recorded or stored is authentic if it is established that the electronic record was generated etc. in the usual and ordinary course of business by a person who was not a party to the proceedings and did not generate etc. under the control of the party seeking to introduce the electronic record
- **Illustration**: A seeks to adduce evidence against *B* in the form of an electronic record. The fact that the electronic record was generated, recorded or stored in the usual and ordinary course of business by *C*, a neutral third party, is a relevant fact for the court to presume that the electronic record is authentic.

EA s116A(3):

- Unless evidence to the contrary is adduced, where an electronic record was generated, recorded or stored by party who is adverse in interest to the party seeking to adduce the evidence, the court shall presume that the electronic record is authentic in relation to the authentication issues arising from the generation, recording or storage of that electronic record
- **Illustration**: A seeks to adduce evidence against B in the form of an electronic record. The fact that the electronic record was generated, recorded or stored by B, who opposes the relevance of the evidence, is a relevant fact for the court to presume that the electronic record is authentic.

**Process for Validating Electronic Record are Relevant Facts:**

- **S9(g) of EA**: To clarify that the processes for validating an electronic record are relevant facts
- ***Illustration**: A seeks to adduce evidence against B in the form of an electronic record.*  *The* *method and manner* *in which the electronic record was (properly or improperly)* *generated, communicated, received or stored* *(by A or B),* *the reliability of the devices* *and* *the circumstances in which the devices were (properly or improperly) used or operated to generate, communicate, receive or store the electronic record, may be* *relevant facts* *(if the contents are relevant) as* *authenticating the electronic record.*

**Weight of Evidence - Technology Involved:**

- Software and programs which are subjected to encryption are likely to be an accurate copy of the original
- Conversely, data or records generated by means of human intervention using computer program or device should be assessed with circumspection

**Approved Process:**

- S116A(5) The Minister may make regulations providing for a process by which a document may be recorded or stored through the use of an imaging system, including providing for the appointment of one or more persons or organisations to certify these systems and their use, and for any matters incidental thereto, and an “approved process” in subsection (6) means a process that has been approved in accordance with the provisions of such regulations.
- S116A(6) Where an electronic record was recorded or stored from a document produced pursuant to an approved process, the court shall presume, unless evidence to the contrary is adduced, that the electronic record accurately reproduces that document

**Rules for filing and receiving evidence and documents in court using information technology:**

EA S36(A):

- S36(A)—(1) The Rules Committee constituted under the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322), and the Family Justice Rules Committee constituted under the Family Justice Act 2014, may make rules to provide for the filing, receiving and recording of evidence and documents in court by the use of information technology in such form, manner or method as may be prescribed.
- (2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), such rules may —
    - (*a*) modify such provisions of this Act as may be necessary for the purpose of facilitating the use of electronic filing of documents in court;
    - *(b*) provide for the burden of proof and rebuttable presumptions in relation to the identity and authority of the person sending or filing the evidence or documents by the use of information technology; and
    - (*c*) provide for the authentication of evidence and documents filed or received by the use of information technology.

**Evidence:**

Steps:

- Where the evidence is
- What the evidence means
- How to put it together

Sources of Evidence:

- Three Basic Sources
    - Users
        - First hand observations
    - Systems + Backups
        - Log files
        - Processes/File remnants
    - Networks/Communications
        - NetFlow Logs
        - Firewall logs
        - Modern banks/telephone logs

Mutable Evidence:

- Computer evidence is endlessly changeable
- Intruder may add/remove/modify log entires
- May compromise system components that maintain the logs
- Investigation may alter files

Chain of Custody:

- Who has had access to the evidence?
- What procedures did they follow in working with the evidence?
- How can we show that our analysis is based on copies that are identical to the original evidence?
- Use documentation and timestamps

**Important Four Steps:**

Identify the Evidence:

- Must identify the type of information that is available
- Determine how to best retrieve it

Preserve the Evidence:

- With the least amount of change possible
- You must be able to account for any changes
- Make copies and timestamp them
- Document who,where,how,when,why
- Give a copy to custodian

Analyse the Evidence:

- Extract, process and interpret
- Make evidence readable
- Deeper understanding of how evidence links tgt

Present the Evidence:

- To management, attorneys, in court etc
- Acceptance depends on
    - Manner and convincing of presentation
    - Qualifications of presenter
    - Credibility of processes used to preserve and analyse the evidence

**Best Evidence Rule:**

- Where nothing is better, the court will resort to admitting evidence which would otherwise be inadmissible in other cases
- This could also mean conversely that the rule may apply to cases in which evidence is excluded because better evidence was available
- Decreasing order of desirability for computer output evidence:
    - Original disk
    - Binary copy of the original disk
    - Log file from disk
    - Records from within a file
    - Contents of a file
    - Collection of files
    - Collection of files with attributes intact
