- Objective is to punish wrongdoers
- Accused if convicted guilty, acquitted if not

    - Driver committed crime of drink driving
    - Driver committed civil wrong of causing injury to pedestrian

**Sources of Singapore Law:**

Constitution of Singapore:

- A collection of rules concerned with establishing and maintaining acceptable norms of behavior so that there is stability in society

Three arms of government:

- Legislature:
    - President and Parliament
    - Main law-making body in SIngapore
    - Critical function and financial control
- Executive:
    - President, Prime Minister and Cabinet
    - Implements Acts of Parliament and executes decision of the Government
- Judiciary:
    - Responsible for administration of justice
    - Judicial power vested in Supreme Court and State Courts

Statutes:

- Laws made or written by the Government or Parliament through an act called legislation
- Eg. Computer Misuse Act, Copyright Act

Purpose of Legislation:

- To introduce new law or repeal existing law no longer relevant
- To consolidate existing laws
- To implement government policy

Legislative Process:

- **First Reading** - Bill is formally introduced in Parliament by any Member of Parliament whereas a Government Bill is introduced by Minister concerned
- **Second Reading** - Minister responsible outlines purpose/reason for law then a general debate may arise covering the great merits and principles of the Bill
- **Third Reading** - Amendments if any will be proposed, the debate at Third reading is confined to contents of the Bill. Bill is then put to vote

Case Law:

- Important source of unwritten law in Singapore
- Case Law has been derived from recorded judgments of judges in cases which come before the courts

Doctrine of Binding Precedents:

- Case law is subject to the doctrine of binding precedents or previous decision
- Under this doctrine:
    - Judge has to follow a prior decision of the courts above in hierarchy IF the case he is now deciding is similar
    - Decision of higher court binds lower courts
- Three Types:
    - Decision of higher court binds all lower courts in same hierarachy
    - Court is not bound by its own prior decision
    - Not bound by decision of court from another hierarchy

English Law:

- Singapore Law was made by reception of English Law
- Mostly repealed or abolished by SG Parliament due to lack of practicality
- However, some English Laws still continue to influence our laws and in some cases became accepted as part of our law (Sales of Good Act)
