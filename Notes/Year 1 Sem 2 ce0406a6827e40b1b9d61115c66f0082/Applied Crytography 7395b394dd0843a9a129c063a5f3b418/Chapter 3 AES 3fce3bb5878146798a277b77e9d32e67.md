**Advanced Encryption Standard (AES):**

Requirements:

- Private key symmetric block cipher
- 128-bit data
- 128/192/256-bit keys
- Stronger and faster than Triple DES
- Used in C and Java implementations
- Provide full specification and design details

Evaluation Criteria:

- Security
    - Effort for practical cryptanalysis
- Cost
    - In terms of computational efficiency
- Algorithm and implementation characteristics
- Flexibility
    - In en/decrypt, keys and other factors
- Came down to the best balance of attributes to meet criteria, in particular the balance between speed, security and flexibility

**Rijndael AES:**

Design Considerations:

- Resistant against known attacks
- Speed and code compactness on most CPUs
- Design simplicity

Features:

- Block cipher processing 16 bytes of 4x4 at a time
- Based on iterative S-P network cipher

Typical Operations:

- Key Expansions
- Initial Round
- Rounds
- Final Round

Byte Substitution:

- Substitution table of 16x16 bytes
- In decryption, inverse S-box is used

Shift Rows:

- Permutes bytes between the columns
- Circular byte shift
    - 1st row unchanged
    - 2nd row shifts by 1 to left
    - 3rd row shifts by 2 to left
    - 4th row shifts by 3 to left
- Decrypts inverts the shifts to right instead of left

Mix Columns:

- Multiplies each column with a 4x4 byte matrix
- Each byte is replaced by a value dependent on all 4 bytes in the column
- Decryption requires use of inverse matrix

Add Round Key:

- XOR state with 128-bits (16 bytes) of the round key
- Reversed keys to decrypt
- Designed to be as simple as possible

Key Expansion:

- Takes 128-bit key and expands into array of 44 x 32-bit words
- Uses Round constants RCON to increase randomness

Decryption:

- Inverse cipher with steps for encryption
    - Use inverses of each step
    - Different key schedule
- No loss of information

Implementation:

- Efficient on 8-bit CPU
- Byte substitution only requires 256 entries
- Shift rows is simple
- Add round key works on byte XOR
- Matrix multiplication
