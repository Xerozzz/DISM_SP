**Objectives:**

- Describe the challenges of securing information
- Define information security and explain why it is important
- Identify the types of attackers that are common today
- Describe the five basic principles of defence

**Challenges of Securing Information:**

- No simple solution
- Many different types of attacks
- Defending against attacks is often difficult

**Reasons for successful attacks:**

- Widespread vulnerabilities
- Configuration issues
- Poorly designed software
- Hardware limitations
- Enterprise-based issues

**Information Security:**

Security:

- To be free from danger is the goal
- The process that achieves that freedom
- When something is more secure, the less convenient it may become to use

Defining Information Security:

- Task of security information in a digital format
- Goal is to ensure that protective measures are properly implemented to ward off attacks and prevent total collapse of the system in the event an attack succeeds

Three types of information protection (CIA):

- Confidentiality:
    - Only approved individuals may access information
- Integrity:
    - Information is correct and unaltered
- Availability:
    - Information is accessible to authorized users

Three layers of information security:

- Products:
    - Form the security around the data, varies from door locks to network security equipment
- People:
    - The ones who implement and properly use security products to protect data
- Procedures and Policies:
    - Plans and policies established by an enterprise to ensure people correctly use security products

Terminology:

- Asset:
    - Item that has value
- Threat:
    - Type of action with the potential to cause harm
- Threat Actor:
    - A person or element with the power to carry out a threat
- Vulnerability:
    - Flaw or weakness that allows a threat actor to bypass security
- Threat Vector:
    - The means by which an attack can occur
- Risk:
    - A situation that involves exposure to danger

**Importance of Information Security:**

Preventing Data Theft:

- Preventing data theft is often the primary objective of an organisation's information security
- Enterprise data theft involves stealing business information
- Personal data theft involves stealing credit card numbers

Thwarting Identity Theft:

- Stealing another person's personal information usually for financial gain
- Eg. Steal person's SSN, file fraudulent tax returns

Avoid Legal Consequences:

- Avoiding the legal consequences of not properly securing data
- Data Privacy - PDPA 2012
- Cybersecurity - Cybersecurity Act 2018
- Cybercrime - Computer Misuse Act (Cap 50A)

Maintaining Productivity:

- Post-attack cleanup diverts time, money and resources away from normal activities
- Reduces productivity

Foiling Cyberterrorism:

- Cyberterrorism - Any premediated, politically motivated attack against information, computer systems, computer programs or data
- Designed to:
    - Cause panic
    - Provoke violence
    - Result in financial catastrophe
- Usually targeted at key facilities such as banking industry, power plants, military installations and water systems

**Threat Actors:**

Script Kiddies:

- Individuals who want to attack computer but lack the ability to do so
- Downloads pre-made hacking scripts online from website

Hactivists:

- Attackers who attack for ideological reasons that are generally not as well-defined as a cyberterrorist's motivation
- Eg. Breaks into website and changing contents to make a political statement
- Eg. Disables a website belonging to a bank because the bank provided bad services

Nation State Actors:

- An attacker commissioned by the governments to attack enemies' information systems
- Targets foreign governments or hostile citizens
- Known for being well-resourced and highly trained
- Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). Multiyear intrusion campaign that targets highly sensitive economic or national security information

Insiders:

- Employees, contractors and business partners
- Stock trader conceal losses through fake transactions
- Employees bribed into stealing data

Competitors:

- Launches attack against an opponent's system to steal classified information
- Competitors may steal research or business information as well as business ideas to gain a competitive edge

Organised Crime:

- Moving from traditional criminal activities to more rewarding and less risky online attacks
- Criminal networks do not commit crimes themselves but act as entrepreneurs to steal money

Brokers:

- Sell their knowledge of a vulnerability to other governments or attackers
- Individuals who uncover vulnerabilities do not report it to the software vendor but instead sell them to the highest bidder

Cyberterrorists:

- Attack's a nation's network and computer infrastructure to cause disruption and panic among citizens
- May include a small group of computers or networks that can affect the largest number of users, such as computers that control the electrical power grid

**Five basic principles of defence:**

Layering:

- Information security must be created in layers
- A single defense mechanism is easily breached
- Unlikely for an attacker to break through all defense layers
- Also called Defense-In-Depth
- Useful to resist a variety of attacks and provides most comprehensive protection

Limiting:

- Limiting access to information reduces the threat against it
- Only those who must use data should have access to it
- Use file permissions or prohibit documents from leaving the premises

Diversity:

- Layers of protection must be diverse and different
- One technique cannot be used to break through all layers
- Use security products from different manufacturers/vendors

Obscurity:

- Obscuring inside details to outsiders
- Eg. Type of computer, OS version, Brand of software
- Difficult for attacker to devise attack if system details are unknown

Simplicity:

- Nature of information security is complex
- Complex systems hard to understand and troubleshoot
- A secure system should be simple from the inside but complex from the outside
