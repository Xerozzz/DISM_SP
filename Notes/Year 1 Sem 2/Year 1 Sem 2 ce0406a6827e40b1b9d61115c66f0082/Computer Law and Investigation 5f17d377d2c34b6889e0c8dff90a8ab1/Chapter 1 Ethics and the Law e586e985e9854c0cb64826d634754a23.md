**Law and Ethics (Overview):**

Ethics:

- A moral philosophy derived from values based on what is deemed right or wrong by tradition, religion, culture and customs

- Deemed as Ideals, Unenforceable and Unexciting by Lawyers

Law:

- the system of rules which a particular country or community recognizes as regulating the actions of its members and which it may enforce by the imposition of penalties
- Eg. Computer Misuse Act, Cybersecurity Act 2018
- Deemed as not absolutely enforceable, unethical and confusing by a Moralist

3 Differences:

- Law applies to everyone while ethics does not
- Law is formulated by Parliament while ethics is formulated by one's experience, culture or tradition
