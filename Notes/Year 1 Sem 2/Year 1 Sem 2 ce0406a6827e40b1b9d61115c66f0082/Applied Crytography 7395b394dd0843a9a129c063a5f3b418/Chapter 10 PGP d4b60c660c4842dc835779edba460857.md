- Privacy/Encryption
- Message Integrity

- Non-repudiation

**Pretty Good Privacy (PGP):**

What is PGP:

- PGP is a program to secure electronic mail to ensure **Privacy** and **Authentication**
- It has proven itself quite capable of resisting even the most sophisticated forms of analysis
- PGP can be used to apply a digital signature and encrypt/decrypt a message

Reasons for PGP's Popularity:

- PGP/OpenPGP is available free worldwide
- Available on a variety of platforms like DOS/Windows, UNIX, Macintosh and others
- PGP is based on algorithms that survived extensive public review and considered very secure
- PGP has a wide range of applicability
- PGP is not controlled by a governmental or standards organisation

Features of PGP:

- Combination of algorithms in a set of utility software for
    - encryption of messages,digests and keys
    - message digest used for digital signature
    - key generation for users' public/private key pairs and session key
    - key management and certification cyclic redundancy check (CRC)

Public Keys:

- Each user has a **private** key as well as a **public** key of each potential correspondent
- PGP maintains a list of public keys that a user has obtained by one means or another (Eg. Thru Email)
- Each item on the public key ring includes several parts:
    - Public key itself
    - User ID of public key owner
    - Key ID to identify key
    - Other information related to trustworthiness of key and owner

Private Keys:

- Each PGP must have a private key
- The private key must be handled with more care
- Stored on the user's private key ring
- Recommended to store this private key ring on a secure USB for security
- Passphrase is required to access key, which is used to generate a symmetric key and encrypts the private key using chosen algorithm and passphrase-based key
- For each private key, it includes the following information:
    - The private key encrypted using the passphrase-based key
    - The owner's User ID
    - A copy of matching public key

**PGP Operational Description:**

Five Services of PGP Operation:

- Digital Signature
- Message Encryption
- Compression
- Email Compatibility
- Segmentation and Reassembly

Digital Signature:

- DSS/SHA-1 or
- RSA/SHA-1
- The first step in generation of a PGP message
    - Sender creates a message
    - PGP uses SHA-1 to generate 160-bit hash code of message
    - Sender specifies the private key to be used for this operation and provides a passphrase enabling PGP to decrypt the sender's private key
    - PGP encrypts hash code with RSA using sender's private key and result is prepended to message
    - Receiver uses RSA with with sender's public key to decrypt and recover the hash code
    - Receiver generates new hash code, the message is authentic if both same
- Combination of RSA and SHA-1 provides an effective scheme
- Strength of RSA ensures only the possessor of matching private key can generate the signature

Message Encryption:

- In PGP, **confidentiality** is achieved by encrypting messages to be transmitted or stored locally as files
- In both cases, the conventional encryption algorithm CAST-128 may be used
- Other algorithms such as IDEA or 3DES or 64-bit cipher feedback mode is used
- In PGP, conventional key is used only once, a new key is generated as a random 128-bit number for each message
- Although it is documented as session key, it is really a one-time key, which is bounded to message and transmitted with it
- The session key is encrypted with receiver's public key to protect it
- PGP steps to encrypt message:
    - Sender generates a message and random 128-bit number to be used as session key for this message only
    - Message is encrypted using CAST-128,IDEA or 3DES with session key
    - Session key is encrypted with RSA using recipient's public key and prepended to message
    - Receiver uses RSA with its private key to decrypt and recover session key
    - Session key is then used to decrypt message

Message Encryption and Digital Signature:

- Used together to provide **authenticity** and **confidentiality**
- Digital signature first generated for plaintext message and prepended to it
- Plaintext message + signature is encrypted using CAST-128,IDEA or 3DES
- Session key is then encrypted using RSA

Compression:

- ZIP
- By default, PGP compresses message after apply signature and before encryption
- Data compression saves transmission time and disk space and strengthen crytographic security by reducing redundancy
- ZIP algorithm:
    - Looks for repeating strings of characters in input and replaces them with compact codes
    - Destination system performs same function and replace those compact codes with original text
    - The more redundancy the more effective the ZIP algorithm
    - Typical text files compress to about 50% of original size

Email Compatibility:

- Radix 64-conversion
- To provide transparency for e-mail applications, an encrypted message may be converted to an ASCII string using radix-64 conversion
- When PGP is used, part of the block to be transmitted is encrypted
- **Signature Services** - The message digest is encrypted with sender's priv key
- **Confidentiality** - Both message and signature encrypted with one time key
- Many electronic mail systems only allow messages made of ASCII text and not 8-bit raw binary data
- PGP supports ASCII radix-64 for ciphertext messages
- Useful for transmitting encrypted data as normal E-mail text by protecting against corruption on Internet, acting as armour
- PGP also appends CRC to detect transmission errors
- Radix-64 expands block of 24 bits plaintext into 4 printable ASCII chars (32 bit)
- File grows by about 33 pecent

Segmentation & Reassembly:

- Nil
- To accommodate maximum message size limitations, PGP performs segmentation and reassembly
- Electronic mail facilities are often restricted to max message length
- Any message longer than allowed size must be broke up into smaller segments and mailed separately
- PGP automatically subdivides a message that is too large into segments that are small enough to send via e-mail
- Segmentation is done after all of other processing, including radix-64 conversion is done
- Session key component and signature component only appear once at beginning of first segment
- At receiving end, PGP must strip off all email header and reassemble entire original block
- This is before performing any appropriate steps to verify or decrypt a message

**Order of Operations in PGP:**

- Create a private and public key pair
- Exchange public keys with others
- Validate your keys
- Sign and encrypt your email and files
- Decrypt and verify your email and files

**PGP E-mail Summary:**

- The De-Facto standard for email encryption
- Strong and sound underlying cryptiography techniques being used
- It is a freeware package and commercial version also available
- Cross-platform email communications
- PGP is packaged in a single appiation which performs encryption, decryption, signing, verification and key management
